### 3D Printed Enclosure
This folder contains the .stl design files for the enclosure shown in the video and I used in my build.  I used printed with PLA and supports are recommended for the ElectroCookie enclosures

- _ElectroCookie Enclosure Tall_: Enclosure for the ElectroCookie/primary controller.  This version is taller to accommodate an ESP mounted on standard pin headers.  Mounting post for the board are designed for M2 screws.

- _ElectroCookie Enclosure v3 w Tabs_: This is the original enclosure for the ElectroCookie.  Shorter than the 'tall' version, it will accomodate an ESP soldered directly to the ElectroCookie (without pin headers).

- _ElectroCookie Lid_: Cover for either one of the enclosures above.

- _VL53L0X Case_: Case and mount for the optional VL53L0X side sensor.
