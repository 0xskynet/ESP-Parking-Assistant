### If you just want to install the firmware on your ESP8266/ESP32, you do not need to download the source code!
Just download the latest **ParkingAsst_vx.xx_ESP8266.bin** (or ...ESP32.bin) file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Resinchem/ESP-Parking-Assistant/releases) and follow the installation and instructions that are found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Resinchem/ESP-Parking-Assistant/wiki).  Please try the steps in the wiki before posting questions about how to install the firmware.

## Source Code
This directory contains the source code .ino sketch for the parking assistant.  You can download and modify this to meet your own needs.  The Parking Assistant supports OTA updates from the Arduino IDE (or other appropriate IDEs).  See the wiki section on Performing Updates and Upgrades for more information on OTA updates using an IDE.

You will need to have the ESP8266/ESP32 boards installed in your environment, plus all the appropriate libraries listed at the top of the sketch file.  If you've not setup the Arduino IDE for the ESP before, this video might help: [Arduino IDE: Basics for Non-Coders](https://youtu.be/KS5HOJat88k)
