## Source Code
This directory contains the source code .ino sketch for the parking assistant.  You can download and modify this to meet your own needs.  The Parking Assistant supports OTA updates from the Arduino IDE (or other appropriate IDEs).  See the wiki section on Performing Updates and Upgrades for more information on OTA updates using an IDE.

You will need to have the ESP8266 boards installed in your environment, plus all the appropriate libraries listed at the top of the sketch file.
